# Dataset Web UI

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the UI:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Serve the UI (for static preview):
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

- The UI expects the FastAPI server to be running at the same root, serving `/api` and `/dataset` endpoints.
